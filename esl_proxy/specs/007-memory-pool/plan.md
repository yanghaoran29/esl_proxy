# Implementation Plan: Memory Pool

**Branch**: `007-memory-pool` | **Date**: 2026-05-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/007-memory-pool/spec.md`

## Summary

A pre-allocated memory pool for DAG task execution supporting: SPSC allocation/deallocation via ring buffer head/tail pointer updates, when2free automatic release based on minimum uncompleted TaskID tracked via Task State Ring Buffer, and a dedicated Manager thread for threshold-based memory reclamation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C11 (`-std=c11`)

**Primary Dependencies**: None (standard C library only)

**Storage**: N/A (in-memory pool)

**Testing**: Unity test framework, microbenchmarks for allocation latency

**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS, x86_64

**Project Type**: Header-only C library (in-memory pool)

**Performance Goals**: Allocation/deallocation < 1μs, when2free release < 1μs after threshold

**Constraints**: SPSC mode only (single producer Orchestrator, single consumer Worker), ring buffer head/tail pointer for O(1) alloc/free

**Scale/Scope**: Pool sizes 1MB-1GB, thousands of concurrent allocations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Compliance Requirement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Modern C11 | C11 standard (`-std=c11`) only; `_Generic`, atomics, `restrict` pointers required; unsafe practices prohibited |
| Callback-Based Async Architecture | Manager thread uses async polling pattern; when2free callbacks for allocation/release; no blocking |
| DAG-Based Task Scheduling | N/A - memory pool component, not DAG scheduler |
| Zero-Copy Task Data Flow | Buffer descriptors (pointer+size) for zero-copy sharing |
| Lock-Free Concurrency | SPSC mode with C11 atomics; ring buffer head/tail pointers are atomic; no mutexes |
| No Blocking in Hot Paths | Manager thread polls without blocking; atomic operations only |
| Deterministic Scheduling | N/A - memory pool component |
| Testability & Reproducibility | Unit tests for alloc/free/error paths; microbenchmarks |
| Header-Only Library | All implementation in headers with `static inline` |
| Trust the Caller | Caller provides valid addresses and TaskIDs; no validation at pool layer |

**Rationale**: Memory pool is a header-only C11 component using ring buffer head/tail pointers for SPSC. Manager thread runs independently with async polling. Ring buffer design provides O(1) allocation without complex data structures.

└── ring_buf.c           # Ring buffer global defs
```

**Structure Decision**: Header-only library under `include/dag/`. Single `mem_pool.h` with `static inline` implementations. Ring buffer head/tail pointer approach for SPSC slot management.

## Ring Buffer Head/Tail Pointer Design

### Allocation (Producer - Orchestrator)
- Uses ring buffer tail offset to allocate variable-sized chunks
- `tail += size` with wraparound at total_size
- O(1) operation: single atomic addition by allocation size

### Release (Consumer - Manager/Worker)
- Uses ring buffer head offset to free in FIFO order
- `head += size` with wraparound at total_size
- O(1) operation: single atomic addition by allocation size

### Why Continuous Ring Buffer Head/Tail?
1. **Continuous Memory**: Pre-allocated memory block without fixed-size slots
2. **Variable-Sized**: Supports any allocation size up to pool remaining
3. **O(1) Allocation**: No search needed - just advance tail by size
4. **O(1) Release**: FIFO order - just advance head by size
5. **SPSC Natural Fit**: Single producer (tail), single consumer (head)
6. **No Fragmentation**: FIFO reuse of continuous memory prevents fragmentation

### State Machine (Continuous SPSC Ring Buffer)

```
[FREE] --[tail += size]--> [ALLOCATED]
[ALLOCATED] --[head += size]--> [FREE]
```

Tail and head are offsets that wrap around at total_size using modulo operation.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Manager thread polling | Decouples when2free release from task execution | Synchronous release would block task execution paths |
| SPSC-only mode | Simplifies lock-free design to ring buffer head/tail | MPMC would require CAS retry loops |
| Continuous memory (no slots) | Variable-sized allocations without wasted space | Fixed slots would waste memory or limit max size |
| Ring buffer head/tail | O(1) alloc/free without complex free-list | Linked-list or bitmap would add overhead |
