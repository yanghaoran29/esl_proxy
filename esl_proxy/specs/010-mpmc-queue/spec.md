# Feature Specification: MPMC Queue

**Feature Branch**: `010-mpmc-queue`

**Created**: 2026-05-26

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "mpmc队列"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Task Dispatch via MPMC Queue (Priority: P1)

A system operator dispatches tasks to workers through a lock-free MPMC (Multi-Producer-Multi-Consumer) queue. Multiple producer threads can enqueue tasks concurrently while multiple consumer threads dequeue tasks independently, with all operations remaining lock-free.

**Why this priority**: The MPMC queue is the primary mechanism for distributing tasks from the DAG scheduler to worker threads. Without it, tasks cannot be dispatched to workers.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by having multiple producer threads enqueue tasks and multiple consumer threads dequeue those tasks concurrently, confirming all tasks are delivered without loss or corruption.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a queue with 1000 tasks enqueued, **When** 4 consumer threads dequeue concurrently, **Then** all 1000 tasks are successfully dequeued
2. **Given** a queue is empty, **When** a consumer attempts to dequeue, **Then** the operation returns a signal indicating queue is empty
3. **Given** a queue is full, **When** a producer attempts to enqueue, **Then** the operation returns a signal indicating queue is full

---

### User Story 2 - Bounded Queue with Backpressure (Priority: P1)

A system operator configures the MPMC queue with a fixed capacity to apply backpressure when producers outpace consumers. When the queue reaches capacity, producers block or return an error rather than unbounded memory growth.

**Why this priority**: Bounded queues prevent memory exhaustion and provide flow control between producers and consumers in the DAG scheduling pipeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by attempting to enqueue more items than queue capacity and confirming appropriate backpressure behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a queue with capacity 100, **When** 100 items are enqueued, **Then** the queue is full and subsequent enqueues return full status
2. **Given** a queue with capacity 100 is full, **When** a consumer dequeues an item, **Then** the queue has room for one more item

---

### User Story 3 - FIFO Ordering (Priority: P2)

A system operator expects tasks to be delivered to consumers in First-In-First-Out order. Tasks enqueued first are dequeued first, ensuring deterministic task ordering within the DAG execution flow.

**Why this priority**: FIFO ordering is critical for DAG scheduling where task dependencies require respecting the order in which tasks were enqueued.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by enqueuing tasks with sequential identifiers and confirming they dequeue in the same order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tasks with IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are enqueued in order, **When** 5 consumers each dequeue one task, **Then** they receive tasks in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. **Given** tasks with IDs 1, 2, 3 are enqueued concurrently by multiple producers, **When** tasks are dequeued, **Then** the relative ordering of concurrent enqueues is non-deterministic but each individual task is delivered exactly once

---

### User Story 4 - Non-Blocking Dequeue Option (Priority: P2)

A system operator can attempt to dequeue a task without blocking. If the queue is empty, the dequeue operation returns immediately with an empty status rather than waiting.

**Why this priority**: Non-blocking dequeue is essential for worker threads that need to check for work without being stuck in a wait state, enabling efficient polling patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by attempting to dequeue from an empty queue and confirming immediate return with empty status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty queue, **When** a non-blocking dequeue is attempted, **Then** the operation returns immediately with empty status
2. **Given** a queue with items, **When** a non-blocking dequeue is attempted, **Then** an item is returned without waiting

---

### User Story 5 - Memory-Efficient Circular Implementation (Priority: P3)

A system operator leverages a circular buffer implementation for the MPMC queue that reuses memory slots. The queue size remains fixed regardless of enqueue/dequeue operations, enabling predictable memory footprint.

**Why this priority**: Circular buffer implementation provides O(1) enqueue and dequeue with minimal memory overhead, critical for high-throughput DAG scheduling.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by monitoring memory usage during sustained enqueue/dequeue operations and confirming stable memory footprint.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a circular buffer queue with capacity 100, **When** 10,000 items are enqueued and dequeued over time, **Then** memory usage remains constant at approximately 100 slots
2. **Given** a circular buffer queue, **When** the producer wraps around to the beginning of the buffer, **Then** it can overwrite slots that have been fully consumed

---

### User Story 6 - Batch Enqueue (Priority: P2)

A system operator enqueues multiple items in a single batch operation, reducing per-item overhead and improving throughput when dispatching groups of related tasks to the queue.

**Why this priority**: Batch enqueue reduces syscall and atomic operation overhead when dispatching multiple tasks, critical for high-throughput DAG scheduling where groups of dependent tasks are often enqueued together.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by enqueuing a batch of 10 items in a single operation and confirming all 10 items are in the queue with correct order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a queue with capacity 100 and 90 items, **When** a batch of 10 items is enqueued, **Then** all 10 items are successfully added and queue is full
2. **Given** a queue with capacity 100 and 95 items, **When** a batch of 10 items is enqueued, **Then** the operation succeeds for 5 items and returns partial batch status for the remaining 5
3. **Given** a batch of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is enqueued together, **When** items are dequeued, **Then** items maintain relative order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

---

### User Story 7 - Batch Dequeue (Priority: P2)

A system operator dequeues multiple items in a single batch operation, allowing workers to fetch multiple waiting tasks at once and reduce per-item coordination overhead.

**Why this priority**: Batch dequeue enables workers to process multiple tasks with a single queue interaction, reducing contention and improving cache locality for sequential task processing.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by enqueuing 100 items and dequeuing a batch of 10, confirming 10 items are returned and queue depth decreases by 10.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a queue with 100 items, **When** a batch dequeue of 10 is attempted, **Then** 10 items are returned and queue has 90 remaining
2. **Given** a queue with 5 items, **When** a batch dequeue of 10 is attempted, **Then** 5 items are returned and queue is empty
3. **Given** a queue with 5 items, **When** a batch dequeue of 10 is attempted in non-blocking mode, **Then** 5 items are returned immediately

---

### User Story 8 - Batch Size Limits and Partial Results (Priority: P2)

A system operator configures maximum batch sizes and handles partial batch results when fewer items than requested are available. The batch API returns the actual number of items processed.

**Why this priority**: Partial batch handling is essential for bounded queues where the number of available items may be less than the requested batch size, enabling graceful degradation without blocking.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by requesting more items than available and confirming partial results are returned with accurate count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a queue with 3 items, **When** a batch dequeue of 10 is requested, **Then** exactly 3 items are returned with batch count of 3
2. **Given** a queue with 3 items, **When** a batch enqueue of 10 is attempted with 7 items needing to wait, **Then** 3 items are enqueued with batch count of 3

- What happens when the queue is empty and multiple consumers try to dequeue simultaneously?
- What happens when producers enqueue faster than consumers can handle (head-of-line blocking)?
- What happens when the queue wraps around multiple times?
- What happens when task data contains pointers that become invalid after dequeue?
- What happens when batch enqueue attempts more items than remaining capacity?
- What happens when batch dequeue requests more items than are available?
