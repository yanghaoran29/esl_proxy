# Tasks: MPMC Queue (BlkRing Non-Blocking)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-mpmc-queue/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (1-Header + 1-C-File Design)

**Purpose**: Create project structure with BlkRing non-blocking queue implementation

- [X] T001 [P] Create include/dag/mpmc_queue.h with BlkRing slot state enum and queue struct
- [X] T002 [P] Create include/dag/mpmc_queue.c for global queue definitions with default capacities

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (BlkRing Core Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**BlkRing Design**: Atomic slot states (EMPTY/FILL/COMPLETE), no CAS retry loops

- [X] T003 [P] Define slot_state_t enum (EMPTY=0, FILL=1, COMPLETE=2) in mpmc_queue.h
- [X] T004 [P] Define blkring_slot_t struct with data pointer and atomic state in mpmc_queue.h
- [X] T005 [P] Define mpmc_queue_t struct with slots array, capacity, producer_idx, consumer_idx in mpmc_queue.h
- [X] T006 Implement mpmc_init() - allocate slots array, init all states to EMPTY
- [X] T007 Implement mpmc_idx() - pos % capacity for circular access
- [X] T008 Implement slot_state_load() - atomic load of slot state
- [X] T009 Implement slot_state_store() - atomic store of slot state
- [X] T010 Implement blkring_produce() - enqueue with single atomic state transition (no CAS retry)
- [X] T011 Implement blkring_consume() - dequeue with single atomic state transition (no CAS retry)
- [X] T012 [P] Define global mpmc_queue_t g_ready_queues[3][4] in mpmc_queue.c

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-14)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Phase 15)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Summary

- **Total tasks**: 43
- **Setup**: 2 tasks (T001-T002)
- **Foundational**: 14 tasks (T003-T015)
- **User Stories**: 25 tasks (T016-T040)
- **Polish**: 3 tasks (T041-T043)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: T001 and T002 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T003, T004, T005, T012, T013 can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **All user stories**: Can run in parallel after foundational completes

## Implementation Strategy

### BlkRing Non-Block Design

1. **Slot States**: Each slot has atomic state (EMPTY/FILL/COMPLETE)
2. **Enqueue (blkring_produce)**:
   - Find next EMPTY slot using producer_idx
   - Claim via atomic_compare_exchange_strong (CAS)
   - Write data to slot
   - State already FILL from CAS success
3. **Dequeue (blkring_consume)**:
   - Find next FILL slot using consumer_idx
   - Claim via atomic_compare_exchange_strong (CAS)
   - Read data from slot
   - Mark COMPLETE then EMPTY for slot reuse
4. **No retry loops**: Each slot operation is a single CAS attempt

### Final Structure

```text
include/dag/
├── mpmc_queue.h     # BlkRing APIs (slot state, produce, consume, batch)
├── mpmc_queue.c     # Global defs (READY_QUEUE_CAPACITY=1024, COMPLETE_QUEUE_CAPACITY=1024)
├── task.h           # Task types (task_type_t, org_mode_t) - existing
└── ring_buf.h/c     # Ring buffer (separate feature)
```

## Notes

- BlkRing provides non-blocking with single-CAS-per-slot design
- All queue operations are O(1) with bounded CAS attempts (1 per slot checked)
- Uses atomic_compare_exchange_strong for slot claiming (single attempt, not retry loop)
- Lock-free operations use C11 atomics only
- No mutexes in hot paths
- Header-only library design with single .c for globals
- Default capacity: 1024 for all queues (ReadyQueue per-queue, CompleteQueue)
