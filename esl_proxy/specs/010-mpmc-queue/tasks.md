# Tasks: MPMC Queue

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-mpmc-queue/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Create project structure and basic configuration

- [X] T001 [P] Create include/dag/mpmc_queue.h with header guard DAG_MPMC_QUEUE_H, mpmc_status_t enum, mpmc_queue_t struct
- [X] T002 [P] Create include/dag/mpmc_queue.c for global queue definitions
- [X] T003 [P] Create include/dag/ready_queue.h with 2D queue matrix API

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core MPMC Queue Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Bounded Queue with Backpressure (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Queue capacity limits and backpressure behavior

**Independent Test**: Verify enqueue returns MPMC_FULL when queue is at capacity

- [X] T018 [US2] mpmc_enqueue() returns MPMC_FULL when tail - head >= capacity
- [X] T019 [US2] mpmc_dequeue() creates available capacity after removal

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - FIFO Ordering (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: FIFO ordering for sequential enqueue/dequeue

**Independent Test**: Verify items dequeue in same order as enqueued

- [X] T020 [US3] Sequential enqueue/dequeue maintains FIFO order

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Non-Blocking Dequeue Option (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Non-blocking dequeue operation

**Independent Test**: Verify dequeue returns immediately with empty status when queue is empty

- [X] T021 [US4] mpmc_dequeue() returns MPMC_EMPTY immediately when queue is empty

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Memory-Efficient Circular Implementation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Circular buffer with wraparound behavior

**Independent Test**: Verify buffer wraparound and memory reuse

- [X] T022 [US5] mpmc_idx() correctly wraps index using pos % capacity

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Batch Enqueue (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Batch enqueue of multiple items

**Independent Test**: Verify batch of 10 items can be enqueued in single call

- [X] T023 [US6] mpmc_enqueue_batch() implementation verified - loop copying items
- [X] T024 [US6] mpmc_enqueue_batch() returns actual count enqueued
- [X] T025 [US6] Partial batch when count exceeds available capacity

---

## Phase 9: User Story 7 - Batch Dequeue (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Batch dequeue of multiple items

**Independent Test**: Verify batch of 10 items can be dequeued in single call

- [X] T026 [US7] mpmc_dequeue_batch() implementation verified - loop copying items
- [X] T027 [US7] mpmc_dequeue_batch() returns actual count dequeued
- [X] T028 [US7] Partial batch when fewer items than requested available

---

## Phase 10: User Story 8 - Batch Size Limits and Partial Results (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Accurate partial batch handling

**Independent Test**: Verify batch API returns accurate count when fewer items than requested

- [X] T029 [US8] mpmc_enqueue_batch() handles partial batch correctly
- [X] T030 [US8] mpmc_dequeue_batch() handles partial batch correctly

## Notes

- Implementation complete - all queue operations functional
- All queue operations are O(1)
- Lock-free operations use C11 atomics only
- No mutexes in hot paths
- Header-only library design
